# Constants-in-Python

So if you have learned any other language like java, C . we also learn constants in it yes?.

First let's see thier Constant

the constant is an identifier whose values cannot be changed thorughout the execution of a program whereas the variable value keeps on changing
('Here showing the difference between variable and constant'^)


The value of a variable can change, but the constant is an identifier that whose value cannot be change.
FOR EX:-
if you have assigned the value of the constant 10 then it will always be 10., You cannot change it with 20 or any other value


NOTE IT :- This is the concept of other programming languages other than python.
in Python we don't read constants, There is no concept in Python regarding Constant.
there are no constants in python the way they exist in C , JavaüòÅüëç

That is, you cannot create constants in Python. 

in Python it is not possible to difine constant whose value cannot changed.
in Python, Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with undersores saprating words but remember its value can be change.
# Just keep in mind that Python does not have a constant.
